Default Repo Setup

New iteration.  Copy the \claudebrain folder somewhere & fire up the container.   

It's basically a postgres container exposing port 5434, and there's your persistent memory.  actually uses less tokens too. 

FOr team use, put the folder on it's own VPS with a static internal IP, and then EVERYONE can share the brain.  Lotta power in that one. 

Have fun with it
