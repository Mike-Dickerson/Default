Mostly this is all about the AI Agent Rules file included th Claude.MD is a set of AI Agnet rules that I've worked on
in using Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor, Q etc... agents.  This helps a LOT with the tendency of AI Agents to "code ahead", add 
"enahncemnts" and place_holders, and arbitrary limits and anythiing else I've found.  

If you come up with additional rules, PLEASE send me the pull request.  Let's make this into a workable ruleset to save
uncountable hours of ghost chasing..
